# Transfer Learning for Vision Models with PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning

Welcome to the repository for our YouTube video series on transfer learning using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning. In this series, we explore using well-known computer vision models like VGG16 and ResNet18 for feature extraction and transfer learning applications. This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that walk you through practical examples, code explanations, and key concepts.

## Included Notebooks

### 1. `FeaturesExtraction_pytorchAndLogisticRegression.ipynb`
This notebook demonstrates:
- Feature extraction using a pre-trained VGG16 model in PyTorch.
- Building and training a logistic regression classifier using the extracted features.
- Key Concepts Covered:
  - Loading a pre-trained model and freezing layers.
  - Extracting features from image data.
  - Training a logistic regression model on top of these features.

### 2. `TransferLearning_pytorch.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on:
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet18 model using PyTorch.
- Customizing the model architecture for a specific classification task.
- Key Concepts Covered:
  - Loading a ResNet18 pre-trained model.
  - Selectively freezing layers and fine-tuning others.
  - Training and evaluation for transfer learning tasks.

### 3. `TransferLearning_pytorchLightning.ipynb`
In this notebook, you will learn about:
- Leveraging PyTorch Lightning to structure and manage transfer learning workflows with ResNet18.
- Creating a `LightningModule` for simplified and efficient model training.
- Key Concepts Covered:
  - Integrating a pre-trained ResNet18 model in the PyTorch Lightning ecosystem.
